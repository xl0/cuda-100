# 100 days of CUDA


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

##### Installation instructions (how I do)

- Create a mamba environment
- `mamba install python=3.12` (pycuda do not work in 3.13 yet)
- `mamba cuda`
- `pip install pycuda`

##### Progress

- [Day 0](https://xl0.github.io/cuda-100/day_00_pycuda.html) - playing
  with PyCUDA
- [Day 1](https://github.com/xl0/cuda-100/tree/master/nbs/day_01_nvcc) -
  playing with NVCC, vector addition.
- [Day 2](https://xl0.github.io/cuda-100/day_02_grayscale.html) - RGB 2
  gray
- [Day 3](https://xl0.github.io/cuda-100/day_03_blurry.html) - RGB blur

Some CUDA (or C) quirks to note:

    uint32_t a =  1;
    int32_t  j = -1;
    j >= a: True
    j +  a: 0

Somehow this is how type casting works in C. :/
